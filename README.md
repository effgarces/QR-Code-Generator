# QR Code blocktype for Mahara

This is a light version from my previous version of this plugin (check credits for those who did the all of the work) that
produces QR code for the current page (aka view) in Mahara. The plugin has been tested on 20.04 stable release.

## Installation

Place the content of the plugin in ``htdocs/blocktype/qrcode`` and navigate to
"Plugin administration" to complete installation.
